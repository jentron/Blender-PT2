# Blender-PT2
This is a fork of the Poser Tools found here: https://www.renderosity.com/mod/freestuff/?item_id=76373

The original Poser Tools allowed Blender 2.61 to import Props, Characters, and Materials. It seems to have fallen out of developement and even the parent website is gone.

I have a lot of old Poser content and thought it would be nifty to resurect this project for Blender 2.8x

How far will I get?
